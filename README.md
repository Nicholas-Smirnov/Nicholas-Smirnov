# 👋 Hey, I’m Nicholas Smirnov  

🎓 CS + Math @ Stony Brook University  
🔬 Researcher in optimization, machine learning, and algorithmic complexity  
💡 I love solving problems rigorously (mathematically), coding them up, and testing them at scale.  

## 🚀 What I’m Passionate About  
- **Optimization + Machine Learning:** I study how algorithms like SGD and Adam behave in high-dimensional, non-convex landscapes — and build PyTorch frameworks to test convergence at scale.  
- **Algorithms + Theory:** I’m obsessed with challenging problems, from Boolean calculus to spectral methods, and I love practice questions that force me to dissect and rebuild ideas mathematically.  
- **Systems + Engineering:** Whether it’s designing interpreters, building ML pipelines for 100GB+ datasets, or simulating orbital mechanics, I thrive where deep reasoning meets real implementation.  
- **Cats + Data:** (Yes, really.) I’ve built pipelines extracting 20K+ cat vocalizations and trained age-classification models on 250K+ feline images.  

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools I Work With  

- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby  
- **ML/AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PANNs, YOLOv8  
-  **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, Google Earth Engine, time-series modeling  
- **Systems & Tools:** Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, Git, OpenCV  

## 🔬 Research & Experience  
- **DIENS Lab @ Stony Brook (2024–):** Zeroth- and first-order optimization for ML; PyTorch frameworks for SGD/Adam; convex analysis meets deep learning.  
- **UT Arlington (REU, 2025):** Built a 100GB+ ML pipeline for cat vocalization analysis with YOLO + PANNs; trained TensorFlow/PyTorch models on 250K+ feline images.  
- **NASA CCRI (2023):** Climate change modeling with satellite imagery and ML (clustering, decision trees, random forests).  
- **Teaching:** TA + instructor experience in CS, math, and even Roblox game dev.  

## 🧩 Selected Projects  
- **BASM (Assembly Interpreter):** A lightweight assembly interpreter in Java + Python ([Repo](https://github.com/Nicholas-Smirnov/BASM)).  
- **Universe Code:** Orbital mechanics simulator with live web visualization ([Demo](http://universecode1.web.app)).  
- **Cat Age Prediction:** Deep learning models for feline age estimation from image + audio datasets.
